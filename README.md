# Dython: Jython API for Vortex Caf√© and OpenSplice

Dython is a tiny and cute Jython API for Vortex Cafe and Vortex OpenSplice.

Jython allow you to work straight with Python objets without requiring any definition of topic types via IDL or Google ProtoBuf.

At the same time, if you want to declare types with IDL that is also possible as it facilitates interoperability with other programming languages.
